# Status and future prospects of deep learning on e-commerce

## Improving the catalog of products: categorized

image & text representation

https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06676

## Visual recommendations and search

solution: triplet networks

https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6622

## challenges

may not have a wealth of relevant annotated data if:
	- catalog taxonomy is new / modified
	- source vs target domain annotated data (e.g. wild vs shop picture)

- use human annotators
- transfer learning
	- adversarial adaptation
